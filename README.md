## React Resizable input with price filter
### Description: 
The app mimics a hotel search engin with a price filter. First, all the hotel options are fetched from a mock API. Then the user can filter the options by both moving toggles of the price range and changing values in the input fields. It's also possible to move the input bar to filter for a specific price range. The range is currently set up with "sticky" values (e.g. 10 steps) but the functionality of the app allows to switch to "non-sticky" values to offer a user a more precise price options.
